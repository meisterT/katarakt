Katarakt
========

katarakt is a simple PDF viewer. It is designed to use as much available screen
space as possible.

Features
--------
There are currently three layouts.

	*	The single layout is active by default. As the name suggests it
		shows one slide at a time. Each page individually is scaled to use the
		maximum available screen space.

	*	The grid layout is a continuous viewing mode, and it supports as many
		columns as you want. The relative size between pages is preserved, and
		the biggest page is zoomed to fit the width of the window.

	*	The presenter layout shows the current and the next slide side by side
		and opens another window to view on the projector.

In addition, with katarakt you can

	*	search for text and step through the results

	*	rotate pages in steps of 90 degrees

	*	click on links to navigate through the document

	*	reload the file to see changes e. g. while editing a LaTeX document.
		With inotify, the document will automatically be reloaded when it changes.

	*	set your own keybindings and customise options.

	*	open a URL. Remote documents are downloaded automatically.

Input is always responsive, because CPU-intensive operations like rendering and
searching are done in parallel. Also, you don't have to wait after changing the
scale or rotation, because the available pages are used until they get
seamlessly replaced by new ones.
