NAME
----
katarakt - a simple PDF viewer with three layouts

SYNOPSIS
--------
*katarakt* (['OPTIONS'] 'FILE'|(-u 'URL'))*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
It's a PDF viewer. It views PDFs.

There are currently three layouts. The 'single layout' is very simple and only
supports scrolling on a per page basis. As the name suggests the current page
is displayed in the center and zoomed to fit the window. It is active by
default.

The 'grid layout' is much more advanced and offers continuous (smooth, per
pixel) scrolling, zooming and adjusting the column count. Pages keep their
correct relative size and are shown in a grid.

The 'presenter layout' is for giving a presentation. It opens a second window,
to be viewed on the beamer, and shows the current and next slide in the main
window.

For every file passed on the command line a separate process is spawned.

OPTIONS
-------
*-u*, *--url* ::
	Instead of opening a local document, download it from the given URL.
*-p*, *--page* 'NUM' ::
	Start on page 'NUM'.
*-f*, *--fullscreen* ::
	Start in fullscreen mode.
*-q*, *--quit* 'true'|'false'::
	If true, quit on initialization failure. If false, show the window even if
	an error occured. Overrides the config option *quit_on_init_fail*.
*-s*, *--single-instance* 'true'|'false'::
	If true, prevents opening the same document twice and focuses the existing
	instance. Overrides the config option *single_instance_per_file*.
*--write-default-config* 'FILE'::
	Write the built-in default configuration to 'FILE' and exit. Hint: on unix
	systems, you can use '--write-defaults /dev/stdout' to print the defaults.
*-h*, *--help* ::
	Print help and exit.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
Variables and key bindings can be changed by modifying the katarakt.ini file.
By default it is read from '$XDG_CONFIG_HOME'.

Variables must be listed under the section "[Settings]", keys under section
"[Keys]". Settings that are not present in the config file use the built-in
default. For a list of all variables with a short explanation see below.

KEY BINDINGS
------------
*q* ::
	Quit *katarakt*.
*1* ::
	Switch to 'single layout'. Views a single page at a time, scaled to fit the
	screen.
*2* ::
	Switch to 'grid layout'. Views pages in a continuous fashion, scaled to fit
	the window width. Supports zooming and multiple columns.
*3* ::
	Switch to 'presenter layout'. Views the current page and a smaller preview
	of the next page. Also, opens a second window that shows only the current
	page for displaying on a beamer.

*Up*, *Down*, *Left*, *Right*, *k*, *j*, *h*, *l* ::
	Move around (up/down/left/right).
*\^u*, *^d* ::
	Scroll up/down half the screen.
*BackSpace*, *Space*, *\^b*, *^f* ::
	Scroll up/down the screen. By default scrolls 90% to create an overlapping
	region.
*PgUp*, *PgDown* ::
	Scroll up/down one page. Kind of swaps the pages in place.

*Home*, *End*, *g*, *G* ::
	Go to the first/last page.
*^g* ::
	Show 'goto page' bar.
*/* ::
	Show the search bar. Hitting *Esc* will hide the results, searching for an
	empty string will clear them. If the search term contains an uppercase
	letter the search is case sensitive ("smartcase").
*?* ::
	Show the search bar. This next search will be backwards.
*n*, *N* ::
	Focus next/previous search hit.
*\^n*, *^N* ::
	Focus next/previous search hit that is currently not visible.

*\^o*, *^i*, *Alt-Left*, *Alt-Right* ::
	Move backward/forward through the jump list. Entries are added
	automatically when jumping.
*m* ::
   Manually add the current page to the jump list.

*-*, *+*, *=* ::
	Adjust zoom level ('grid layout' only).
*z* ::
	Reset zoom level to default, i.e. fit width ('grid layout' only).
*[*, *]* ::
	Adjust column count ('grid layout' only).
*{*, *}* ::
	Adjust the column the first page will be displayed in. Useful for reading
	in a book layout with a cover page ('grid layout' only).
*,*, *.* ::
	Rotate pages left/right.

*t* ::
	Toggle the page number display in the bottom right corner.
*i* ::
	Toggle between normal and inverted color rendering.
*^c* ::
	Copy the current selection to the global clipboard.
*v* ::
	Swap the mouse buttons for selection and panning. The the left mouse
	button's current operation is indicated by the mouse cursor.
*f* ::
	Toggle fullscreen.
*r* ::
	Reload the document. This can also be achieved by sending SIGUSR1 to the
	process. *katarakt* reloads automatically if the opened file has changed.
*o* ::
	Open a different document; shows a file dialog.
*p* ::
	Print current document via lp; shows a printer dialog.
*s* ::
	Show a file dialog to save the current document.
*F9* ::

	are supported to select with word/line granularity.
'int' *smooth_scroll_delta* ::
	30: Pixel offset when moving around.
'float' *screen_scroll_factor* ::
	0.9: Factor for scrolling the screen. Should be \<= 1 to create an
	overlapping region.
'float' *jump_padding* ::
	0.2: Distance from the border of the screen to keep for jump targets, e.g.
	search hits. Moves the view so that search hits are centered more.
'int' *rect_margin* ::

'int' *useless_gap* ::
	2: Gap between two pages in 'grid layout' in pixels.

'bool' *quit_on_init_fail* ::

	See link:http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/stylesheet.html[]. It can be overridden
